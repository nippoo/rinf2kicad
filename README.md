# rinf2kicad
Python script to convert RINF netlist to KiCad netlist

Inspired by [fjullien's original C script](https://github.com/fjullien/rnif2ki), this has now been rewritten in Python.

Converts RINF format (CADStar, ORCAD, etc) netlist to a KiCad 'version D' netlist (still opens fine as of KiCad 8.0).

Usage is simple: `python rinf2kicad.py input_file output_file`.

Pull requests gladly accepted!
